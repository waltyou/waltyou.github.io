## Managing Your Boss

> The trend in governments and businesses is toward simpler and more straightforward communications.

### PowerPhrases at the Interview

>  *In addition to preparing your PowerPhrases, learn everything you can about the company. Read their web pages, annual report, journals and newsletters. Talk to everyone that you know who knows anything about the company. Also be certain to request a job description for the position you are applying for so you can prepare to show them how you can meet their needs.*

### PowerPhrase Responses to Common Interview Questions

A very popular ice-breaking interview question is: “Tell me about yourself.”

Get creative! You don’t need to respond mechanically by saying something like:

*— My name is... and I come from... 
— My hobbies are...
— What I like to do best is...*

Instead, be specific and use a **PowerPhrase for Describing Yourself,** such as:

- **My strengths are... An example is...**
- **My accomplishments are... For example...**
- **My greatest area of knowledge is... I have used this by...**

Or ask:

**• Is there a particular area you would like for me to discuss?**

When asked why you are in the job market, don't say:
*—  They didn’t appreciate me where I was.*
*—  My boss was an idiot.*
*—  I did not like it.*
*—  I was personally responsible for the company declaring bankruptcy.*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Why You Are in the Job Market**, such as:

- **I have a plan for my career. I need a place that offers opportunity for growth.**

- **I am ready for a new set of challenges.**

- **I want a job that I can give my all to and that I can stay in for a long time. I’m looking for the right opportunity.**

When they ask why you are the best person for the job, don’t say:

*—  I think this is a good place to work.*

*—  Nothing else looked interesting.*

*—  I’m out of work.*

*—  I don’t know for sure that I am because I haven’t met the other candidates.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Why You Are the Best for the Job,** such as:

- **I put my heart into everything I do. For example...**
- **I thrive on problem solving and challenges. For example...**
- **You need someone who can produce results. My track record shows that I am that kind of a person.**
- **This job is exactly what I want. What I can do for you is...**
- **My experience demonstrates my versatility.**

> *You want to have an attitude of confidence at the inter- view, and the attitude you project will be a reflection of your thoughts.*
>
> *think:*
>
> - **I have much to offer.**
> - **This is an opportunity to find out if we are a match.**
> - **I am here to learn about them as well as for them to learn about me.**

### Asking the Interviewer PowerPhrase Questions

When the interviewer asks if you have questions, don’t say:

- *No. (Implies that you don’t really care.)*
- *Not really. (Now you sound like you don’t care and you are uncertain as well!)*
- *How much will you pay me? (Only interested in what you can get)*
- *What happened to the person who had the job before me? (Negative)*
- *What does this company do, anyway? (Under-prepared)*

Be prepared with **PowerPhrase Questions for the Inter- viewer**, such as:

- **What else can I tell you about my qualifications?**
- **What are the initial responsibilities of the position?**
- **What problems face your staff?**
- **What is the growth potential in this position?**
- **How long have you been here? What do** **you** **like about the company?**
- **What would the characteristics and experience of the perfect applicant be?**
- **What is the mission of the company?**

### Going for Closure With PowerPhrases Without Being Pushy

Do not leave the interview without going for some closure. Toward the end of the interview, create a sense of value and urgency by using **PowerPhrases That Push for Action.**

- **Are there any qualities you are looking for that you haven’t seen in me?**
- **Is there anything you want to know that I haven’t told you?**
- **What can I tell you that would prompt you to make an offer now?**
- **Can you offer me the job?**

If they say no, ask:

**• Can you refer me to someone who can use my skills?**

If they say they will consider the application and get back to you, say:

- **When can I expect your decision?**
- **If I have not heard from you by then, may I call you?**

### PowerPhrases for When You Are New on the Job

Don’t say:

*— That’s not how we did it at Widget Direct.*

Use **PowerPhrases for Your Early Days on the Job,** such as:

- **I’m looking forward to understanding how you do it here.**
- **I am happy to do it your way.**



Don’t say:

*— Let me tell you all about myself!*

Say:

**• I’m anxious to learn about you.**



Don’t say:

*— I can figure it out myself.*

Say:

**• I need your help.**

**• I need your advice.**

**• I can use some input here.**



When you make inevitable errors or don’t know what is expected of you, avoid saying:

*— I’m only human!
 — Be nice to me, I’m new.
 — I haven’t got the experience.*

Use **PowerPhrases for Reminding Them That You Are New,** such as:

- **I apologize. I am still in my learning curve.**
- **I just made another mistake to learn from.**
- **That is the last time I will make that mistake!**

> Admit Fault When Appropriate
>
> *Say:*
>
> **• I’m sorry.
>  • Please forgive me.
>  • It will never happen again.
> ** *If you really messed up, follow this with:* **• How can I make it up to you?**

Do not wait for your coworkers to tell you everything. **Use PowerPhrase Questions for New Employees,** such as:

- **How can I help?**
- **What more can I do?**
- **How am I doing?**
- **What are my priorities?**

### PowerPhrases for Your Supervisor

Time spent getting to know your boss is time well invested.

Do not say:

- *This isn’t what I was hired to do.*
- *When are you going to tell me what to do?*
- *I don’t have a plan, that’s your job.*

**Use PowerPhrases for Meeting Your Boss**, such as:

- **I’m xxx and am looking forward to working with you.**
- **Can you give me a quick sense of the priorities in the department?**
- **When you have a chance, I have some action ideas of my own that I would like your opinion on.**

Every manager has their own idea of how things should be done. You need to study your manager’s style. Ask questions about how your boss wants things.

Don’t say:

*— This isn’t how my old boss did things.
— You need to tell me what to do.
 — I have my own way of doing things.*

Instead, ask questions and make remarks such as the fol- lowing **PowerPhrases for Getting to Know Your Boss.**

 - **What more can I do to help you?**
- **I look forward to understanding your style.**
- **I want to learn what you need from me.**
- **May I take notes?**
- **What did you particularly like about the way the last person who had this position did the job?**
- **I’d like to know more about you in order to best understand how to work with you.**
