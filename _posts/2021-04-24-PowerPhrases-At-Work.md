## Managing Your Boss

> The trend in governments and businesses is toward simpler and more straightforward communications.

### PowerPhrases at the Interview

>  *In addition to preparing your PowerPhrases, learn everything you can about the company. Read their web pages, annual report, journals and newsletters. Talk to everyone that you know who knows anything about the company. Also be certain to request a job description for the position you are applying for so you can prepare to show them how you can meet their needs.*

### PowerPhrase Responses to Common Interview Questions

A very popular ice-breaking interview question is: “Tell me about yourself.”

Get creative! You don’t need to respond mechanically by saying something like:

*— My name is... and I come from... 
— My hobbies are...
— What I like to do best is...*

Instead, be specific and use a **PowerPhrase for Describing Yourself,** such as:

- **My strengths are... An example is...**
- **My accomplishments are... For example...**
- **My greatest area of knowledge is... I have used this by...**

Or ask:

**• Is there a particular area you would like for me to discuss?**

When asked why you are in the job market, don't say:
*—  They didn’t appreciate me where I was.*
*—  My boss was an idiot.*
*—  I did not like it.*
*—  I was personally responsible for the company declaring bankruptcy.*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Why You Are in the Job Market**, such as:

- **I have a plan for my career. I need a place that offers opportunity for growth.**

- **I am ready for a new set of challenges.**

- **I want a job that I can give my all to and that I can stay in for a long time. I’m looking for the right opportunity.**

When they ask why you are the best person for the job, don’t say:

*—  I think this is a good place to work.*

*—  Nothing else looked interesting.*

*—  I’m out of work.*

*—  I don’t know for sure that I am because I haven’t met the other candidates.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Why You Are the Best for the Job,** such as:

- **I put my heart into everything I do. For example...**
- **I thrive on problem solving and challenges. For example...**
- **You need someone who can produce results. My track record shows that I am that kind of a person.**
- **This job is exactly what I want. What I can do for you is...**
- **My experience demonstrates my versatility.**

> *You want to have an attitude of confidence at the inter- view, and the attitude you project will be a reflection of your thoughts.*
>
> *think:*
>
> - **I have much to offer.**
> - **This is an opportunity to find out if we are a match.**
> - **I am here to learn about them as well as for them to learn about me.**

### Asking the Interviewer PowerPhrase Questions

When the interviewer asks if you have questions, don’t say:

- *No. (Implies that you don’t really care.)*
- *Not really. (Now you sound like you don’t care and you are uncertain as well!)*
- *How much will you pay me? (Only interested in what you can get)*
- *What happened to the person who had the job before me? (Negative)*
- *What does this company do, anyway? (Under-prepared)*

Be prepared with **PowerPhrase Questions for the Inter- viewer**, such as:

- **What else can I tell you about my qualifications?**
- **What are the initial responsibilities of the position?**
- **What problems face your staff?**
- **What is the growth potential in this position?**
- **How long have you been here? What do** **you** **like about the company?**
- **What would the characteristics and experience of the perfect applicant be?**
- **What is the mission of the company?**

### Going for Closure With PowerPhrases Without Being Pushy

Do not leave the interview without going for some closure. Toward the end of the interview, create a sense of value and urgency by using **PowerPhrases That Push for Action.**

- **Are there any qualities you are looking for that you haven’t seen in me?**
- **Is there anything you want to know that I haven’t told you?**
- **What can I tell you that would prompt you to make an offer now?**
- **Can you offer me the job?**

If they say no, ask:

**• Can you refer me to someone who can use my skills?**

If they say they will consider the application and get back to you, say:

- **When can I expect your decision?**
- **If I have not heard from you by then, may I call you?**

### PowerPhrases for When You Are New on the Job

Don’t say:

*— That’s not how we did it at Widget Direct.*

Use **PowerPhrases for Your Early Days on the Job,** such as:

- **I’m looking forward to understanding how you do it here.**
- **I am happy to do it your way.**



Don’t say:

*— Let me tell you all about myself!*

Say:

**• I’m anxious to learn about you.**



Don’t say:

*— I can figure it out myself.*

Say:

**• I need your help.**

**• I need your advice.**

**• I can use some input here.**



When you make inevitable errors or don’t know what is expected of you, avoid saying:

*— I’m only human!
 — Be nice to me, I’m new.
 — I haven’t got the experience.*

Use **PowerPhrases for Reminding Them That You Are New,** such as:

- **I apologize. I am still in my learning curve.**
- **I just made another mistake to learn from.**
- **That is the last time I will make that mistake!**

> Admit Fault When Appropriate
>
> *Say:*
>
> **• I’m sorry.
>  • Please forgive me.
>  • It will never happen again.
> ** *If you really messed up, follow this with:* **• How can I make it up to you?**

Do not wait for your coworkers to tell you everything. **Use PowerPhrase Questions for New Employees,** such as:

- **How can I help?**
- **What more can I do?**
- **How am I doing?**
- **What are my priorities?**

### PowerPhrases for Your Supervisor

Time spent getting to know your boss is time well invested.

Do not say:

- *This isn’t what I was hired to do.*
- *When are you going to tell me what to do?*
- *I don’t have a plan, that’s your job.*

**Use PowerPhrases for Meeting Your Boss**, such as:

- **I’m xxx and am looking forward to working with you.**
- **Can you give me a quick sense of the priorities in the department?**
- **When you have a chance, I have some action ideas of my own that I would like your opinion on.**

Every manager has their own idea of how things should be done. You need to study your manager’s style. Ask questions about how your boss wants things.

Don’t say:

*— This isn’t how my old boss did things.
— You need to tell me what to do.
 — I have my own way of doing things.*

Instead, ask questions and make remarks such as the fol- lowing **PowerPhrases for Getting to Know Your Boss.**

 - **What more can I do to help you?**
- **I look forward to understanding your style.**
- **I want to learn what you need from me.**
- **May I take notes?**
- **What did you particularly like about the way the last person who had this position did the job?**
- **I’d like to know more about you in order to best understand how to work with you.**

### Making Suggestions to Your Boss

If they like to think that they thought of everything, don’t say:

*— My advice is...
 — Obviously you should... 
 — Try this...*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Making Suggestions to the Boss,** such as:

- **Have you considered...?**
- **Something you said the other day got me thinking...**
- **I’d like your opinion about what I did with the concepts you and I discussed last month.**

The better worded a disagreement is, the easier it is to bypass the sense of being in conflict.

Don’t say:

*— You’re wrong.*
*— You shouldn’t see it that way.* 
*— I disagree.*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Disagreeing With the Boss,** such as:

- **Help me to understand how you reached that conclusion.**
- **I wonder if we have the same information. My information leads me to a different conclusion.**
- **I want to give my best here. I can support you better if we can resolve these differences first.**

Have a fallback position if the boss does not appreciate your candor.

- **I know that you are the boss and I will do whatever you say.**

### Refusing Assignments

When you refuse an assignment, don’t say:

*— I can’t.*

*— I don’t have the skills.*

*— I’m overloaded already.*

*— Why do I get all the crummy assignments?*

*— What do I look like here, Wonder Woman/ Superman?*

Begin by clarifying the request. Ask detailed questions so you know the scope.

Be certain to ask the following **PowerPhrases for Clarifying an Assignment**, such as:

- **I need more information. What is the deadline?**
- **I need more information. What budget is allotted?**
- **I need more information. What are the specifications?**
- **Which is the most binding of the three, and how flexible are the others?**

**The Three-Step Process for Saying No to Refuse Assignments**

| **Acknowledge**                                              | **Circumstance**                                             | **Transform**                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| This project is so important it needs someone who can make it his or her top priority. | I have the following projects and deadlines...               | Let me look into it and come back with a list of questions and recommendations. |
| I am flattered that you considered me for this assignment.   | After reviewing it I see some problems that need to be reviewed before proceeding. | Let’s discuss the prob- lems I see and what options we can create. |
| I take this project very seriously.                          | The risks I see in my taking this on are...                  | If we can resolve these I will be happy to take this on.     |
| I prefer to say yes to every assignment you offer me.        | My concerns are...                                           | What can I put aside to free myself up for this?             |

### Handling Multiple Supervisors

Refer to that sys- tem to keep you out of the middle.

As tempting as it is, refrain from saying:

*— Take a number.
 — I can’t help you.
 — Your project is not my only priority. — You’re not the only one I support here.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Managing Work From Multiple Bosses**, such as:

| **Acknowledge**| **Circumstance**   | **Transform** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I would love to help. | Mary has already scheduled my time.                      | Why not talk to Mary? Perhaps she can give you priority. |
|                           | According to the system we established, I prioritize work by... | I will be able to get to this by....                     |

> Replace Limiting Thinking With Power Thoughts
>
> *When managers conflict on priorities, stay out of the middle.*
>
> *You may think:
>  — I’ve got to balance all their conflicting demands. 
>  — It’s up to me to figure this out.*
>
> *You are better off thinking:*
>
> **• Their conflicts are between them and I will allow them to resolve them.**
>
> **• We can develop systems that everyone agrees to and I will follow them.**

### Meeting With Your Managers

Ask for the meetings you need with your boss, but do it with grace. Refrain from complaining:

*— You never have enough time for me. 
— Everything else comes first.
— It seems like I don’t matter.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Requesting Regular Meetings With Your Boss,** such as:

- **If we meet for ten minutes on a daily basis, I won’t need to interrupt you as frequently throughout the day.**
- **I have found in the past that meeting on a daily basis increases my productivity and allows me to stay in tune with you. It helps me make you look good.**
- **Let’s try meeting on a daily basis, monitor the results and see if it is something we would like to continue.**

Also, advocate for regular performance reviews. 

Don’t say:

*— I’m afraid I may be doing something wrong. — You promised!
 — I’m low on the totem pole here.*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Requesting a Performance Review,** such as:

- **To give my best possible I want to set a time to review my progress and set some goals. When can we do that?**
- **I work best with regular feedback, and I want to do the best job possible here.**

Be an active participant at your performance review! Performance reviews are wonderful ways to get what you need. Use **PowerPhrases for Making Your Accomplishments Known in a Performance Review**, such as:

- **May I begin by telling you the accomplishments I am most proud of?**
- **Here is how I made money for the company...**
- **Here is how I saved money for the company...**
- **Here are three problems I faced last year. What I did to resolve them is...**
- **I want to invite you to tell me what you are most pleased about.**

Be sure to use the review as an opportunity to find out what the boss sees as good performance, and what it takes to get a promotion.

- **My understanding is that my priority is to (reconfigure widgets). I have been assembling 257 per day. Is this the best use of my time?**
- **I want to know in detail what the measurements of good performance are.**
- **What can I do differently to meet your requirements?**

Even weaknesses can be turned in to strengths at performance reviews.
-  **Here are some of the areas I have been weak. Here is what I am doing to overcome them.**
- **I realized I was weak in accounting so I took classes.**

Summarize your understanding.
- **• My understanding is that I am in good shape and you want me to...(start assembling wind-up widg- ets). Is this correct?**

### Accepting Feedback

How do you accept praise and criticism from your employer? When praised, don’t deflect the compliment by saying:

*— It was nothing.
 — It was my team. (Unless it was!)*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Accepting Compliments From the Boss,** such as:

- **Thank you. That means a lot, especially from you.**
- **Thank you. It helped that I had such great support from my team.**
- **Thank you. I feel great about it too.**
- **Thank you for noticing.**

How do you respond to criticism from a supervisor? Be very careful to avoid arguing. Avoid words like:

*—  You’re wrong.*
*—  You don’t have a clue what I do for you.*
*—  After all that I do for you, all you notice are the mistakes.*
*—  Whatever you say...*
*—  Yeah, but YOU...*

Instead, respond with a **PowerPhrase for Accepting Criticism,** such as:

- **I wasn’t aware that there was a problem. I want to hear your feedback to understand what needs to be changed.**
- **I understand why you viewed it that way. Next time, I will handle it by doing... I want to do whatever I can to strengthen our working relation- ship. I consider us a team.**7
- **I plan to take this information and devise a plan to improve my performance.**

One powerful way to respond to criticism is to seek clarification of the speaker’s point of view.

- **What else would you like to see me do differently?**

- **What do you mean by...?**
- **Do I understand you correctly that...? **
- **What needs to be done at this point?**

A performance review is a good time to request the resources you need to do a better job. That doesn’t mean you should complain and say:

*—  I can’t meet my objectives because you...*

*—  I am not getting the results I want because I do not have...*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase to Request Resources,** such as:

- **A few things that would increase my productivity are...**
- **My research has shown that these are the costs... and these are the savings... of obtaining the following resources...**



###  Breaking Bad News to the Boss

Avoid saying:

*—  That idiot Jenkins withdrew his account. He just wasn’t patient enough to see this thing through.*

*—  I won’t meet the deadline.*

*—  I should have...*

Instead, do your homework before speaking. Make sure there really is a problem. Then take immediate action. Come armed with all possible solutions. Look ahead to the future.

Use a **PowerPhrase for Breaking Bad News to the Boss,** such as:

- **I made a mistake. I did not realize...**(that Jenkins needed more consistent updates than most of our clients require, and I updated him as I do our other clients.) **He...**(became nervous and withdrew his account before our approach had a chance to pay off.) **Some measures I have taken are...**

- **I have some bad news. There have been...**(major delays) **and...**(we are unable to meet the quality requirements within the given deadline.) **Here are three recommendations of how we can address the client’s concerns. Number 1....**

- **To do the best job possible, I need one more week.**
- **Next time I will ...**

### Speaking With the Boss’s Authority

Often support personnel downplay their role with words like:

*— I was wondering if maybe you could...*

*— Here’s what I want you to do...*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Communicating With Your Boss’s Authority,** such as:

- **Ms. Big has sent me to get the following files...**
- **I know Mr. Big’s expectations. This is what must be done...**
- **Joe Important did not suggest that there would be any problem in obtaining your support on his behalf.**

These phrases carry more impact when the boss has credentialed you his or herself. Some supervisors use **PowerPhrases to Credential Their Staff,** such as:

- **When xxxx opens her mouth my voice comes out.**
- **While I am away I expect you to regard what xxx says as if you heard it from me.**
- **She’s the boss when I’m gone.**



## Communicating With Coworkers

Offer help and ask for help when you need it. For exam- ple, if you are making labels, ask yourself who else can use labels. Then offer:

- **Joan, I’m making labels, do you want some too?**

Ask:

- **What can I do for you?**

Say:

- **I need your help.**

These are all PowerPhrases.

Take an interest in your peers. Listen, listen, and listen.

Here is what you don’t want to say:

*— I’d like to get to know you. Let me tell you all about myself.*

*— Let me tell you about the week I had. It all started with...*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Expressing Interest**, such as:

- **There is so much I want to learn from you.**
- **Tell me what it’s like for you around here.**
- **I’d like a chance to speak with you. When can we arrange that?**
- **Do you mind if I pick your brain?**
- **Can I take you to lunch?**

Be sure to solicit support for your ideas from your col- leagues to encourage buy-in. Rather than simply asking for support, GIVE them something. Use a **PowerPhrase for Soliciting Support for an Idea,** such as:

- **Joan, I want to give you the first chance to review the XYZ proposal before the meeting. Your recom- mendations and support will help it in the approval process.**
- **I invite your involvement in the spring-loaded widget project in its early development when you can still help shape things. Your expertise can make a huge difference here.**



### Giving Feedback to Coworkers

When someone suggests an idea and requests your feedback, avoid being a wet blan- ket and saying things like:

*— What’s wrong with the way things are now?*

*— You’re kidding, right?*

If that is your first impulse, reply with a **PowerPhrase to Buy Time to Consider an Idea,** such as:

- **That’s an interesting idea.**
- **I never thought of that.**

When you do give feedback, consider the following.

#### 1. Feedback Needs to Be Specific.

They need to be able to apply the ideas. Don’t use vague words like:

*— Great job!*

*— You could have done a better job.*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Specific Feedback,** such as:

- **I particularly like the way you did A. What I like most about how you did it is...**
- **A, B and C work well. Some suggestions I have for D, E and F are...**

#### 2. Feedback Needs to Be Solution Oriented.

If there are problems, focus on how they can be fixed. Instead of saying:

*— This is wrong and that is wrong and everything else is awful too.*

Use a **PowerPhrase for Offering Solutions in Feedback,** such as:

**• One way to strengthen A is... Have you considered ... for B? C could be improved by...**
