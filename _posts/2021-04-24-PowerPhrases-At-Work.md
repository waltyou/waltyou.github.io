## Managing Your Boss

> The trend in governments and businesses is toward simpler and more straightforward communications.

### PowerPhrases at the Interview

>  *In addition to preparing your PowerPhrases, learn everything you can about the company. Read their web pages, annual report, journals and newsletters. Talk to everyone that you know who knows anything about the company. Also be certain to request a job description for the position you are applying for so you can prepare to show them how you can meet their needs.*

#### PowerPhrase Responses to Common Interview Questions

A very popular ice-breaking interview question is: “Tell me about yourself.”

Get creative! You don’t need to respond mechanically by saying something like:

*— My name is... and I come from... 
— My hobbies are...
— What I like to do best is...*

Instead, be specific and use a **PowerPhrase for Describing Yourself,** such as:

- **My strengths are... An example is...**
- **My accomplishments are... For example...**
- **My greatest area of knowledge is... I have used this by...**

Or ask:

**• Is there a particular area you would like for me to discuss?**

When asked why you are in the job market, don't say:
*—  They didn’t appreciate me where I was.*
*—  My boss was an idiot.*
*—  I did not like it.*
*—  I was personally responsible for the company declaring bankruptcy.*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Why You Are in the Job Market**, such as:

- **I have a plan for my career. I need a place that offers opportunity for growth.**

- **I am ready for a new set of challenges.**

- **I want a job that I can give my all to and that I can stay in for a long time. I’m looking for the right opportunity.**

When they ask why you are the best person for the job, don’t say:

*—  I think this is a good place to work.*

*—  Nothing else looked interesting.*

*—  I’m out of work.*

*—  I don’t know for sure that I am because I haven’t met the other candidates.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Why You Are the Best for the Job,** such as:

- **I put my heart into everything I do. For example...**
- **I thrive on problem solving and challenges. For example...**
- **You need someone who can produce results. My track record shows that I am that kind of a person.**
- **This job is exactly what I want. What I can do for you is...**
- **My experience demonstrates my versatility.**
