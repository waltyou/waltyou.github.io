## Poison Phrases vs PowerPhrases

### 1. Avoid Filler Poison Phrases

Qualifiers, hedges and softener phrases weaken your message. Anything you say that does not add to your message makes it weaker:

— Well...

— Sort of...

— I just...

— I would tend to... 

— I guess...


Use:

- **This is the best proposal...**

Instead of :

- You know? 
- Isn’t it?
- Right?
- Do you see?



### 2. Replace Indecisive Poison Phrases WithDecisive PowerPhrases

Speak with certainty and decisiveness. If you cannot be certain on one position, express what you can be certain about.

| **Avoid**                     | **Replace with**               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| I should...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I’ll try...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I might be able to...         | **What I can commit to is...** |
| I sort of think...            | **I know...**                  |
| It’s just my opinion...       | **I believe...**               |
| I would tend to think...      | **I think...**                 |
| You might want to consider... | **I recommend...**             |

| I can’t...                                              | **What I can do is...**                         |
| I am spending time...                                   | **I am investing time...**                      |

### 5. Replace Absolute Poison Phrases and Labels With Accurate PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**            | **Replace with**                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| You always...        | **On several occasions you have...**                       |

| You’re lazy.         | **Your performance is not up to standard.**                |
| You are incompetent. | **There are several mistakes here that need to be fixed.** |

### 6. Replace Victim Poison Phrases With PowerPhrases That Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due

Avoid saying:

- You make me so mad.

- You make me feel wonderful !

Those phrases imply you have no control over your own emotions. You don’t want to send that message. Avoid implying that you do not have the ability to choose alter- native thoughts and behaviors.

You may have heard it suggested that you should replace accusative sounding “you” statements with “I” state- ments, such as:

- I feel angry when you...

- I feel wonderful when you...

If the subject of your communication is your anger or wonderful feelings, the above statements are appropriate and accurate PowerPhrases. If the subject is something else, the above statements are not PowerPhrases.

If the point you want to make is that Joe’s tardiness caus- es you all kinds of problems, do not make Joe or yourself the subject of the communication. Rather than saying:

*— You make me mad when you come late.*

or:

*— I get angry when you are late.*

Use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Em- phasis Where It Is Due**, such as:

- Starting late causes serious problems which we need to address.



Do not say:

*— You are not being clear. (Accusatory)*

*— I am not following you. (Makes you the subject.)*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due,** such as:

- Please clarify this point.

- That last point is not clear to me.

### 7. Replace Hints and Vague Poison Phrases With Specific PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                          | **Replace with**                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I sure wish someone would...       | **Will you...**                                              |
| I’d like to have something like... | **I want ___ by___ because___.**                             |
| You need to do a better job.       | **Your performance needs to be improved. Here are the criteria for acceptable performance. Number one...** |

### 8. Avoid Emotional Poison Phrases in Business Situations Where Factual Action-Based PowerPhrases Hold More Power

| **Avoid**                         | **Replace with**                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I feel great about this proposal. | **This proposal will improve our bottom line by ___.**       |
| I don’t like this idea.           | **There are three serious problems with this idea. First...** |
| I am angry about this delay.      | **How do you plan to get back on schedule after this delay?** |

###  9. Avoid Passive Poison Phrases and Replace With Active PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                                       | **Replace with**                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| The acquisition contract was signed by the CFO. | **The CFO signed the acquisition contract.** |
| The bone was buried by the dog.                 | **The dog buried the bone.**                 |



## How to say "No"

### The Three-Step Process for Saying “No”

When You Refuse a Request, **ACT**!

**1. Acknowledge** their request.

Say something to recognize their request. Make a short comment to let them know that you heard them and you are considering what they said.

**2.** Clarify your **Circumstance.**

Tell them a little bit about your own situation. Be brief. Mention what it is that keeps you from being able to honor their request.

**3. Transform** your refusal into a positive. Suggest alternatives or make a comment that reaffirms the relationship such as:

- Some other time.

Put them all together and you have a three-step “no.”

- It sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately I have other priorities. Perhaps next time I can.



| **Acknowledge**                     | **Circumstances**                                            | **Transform**                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| I understand this is important.     | My situation is ...                                          | Perhaps next time.                              |
| Ordinarily I would love to help.    | My policy is ...                                             | Thanks for asking.                              |
| I appreciate you thinking of me.    | I have other plans...                                        | I’m sure you’ll find the right person you need. |
| I would if I could.                 | I have other involvements.                                   | Have you considered..?                          |
| I wish I could help out here.       | I’m not well-suited to do what you want.                     | Here’s an option...                             |
| I see you need help.                | After looking at my calendar I see I can’t give you the help you need. | Have you considered asking ___?                 |
| I’m honored that you thought of me. | After realizing the scope of the request, I choose to pass.  | I wish you success.                             |

### Saying “No” in Two Parts

When you say no in two parts, it sounds stronger. Some people’s sensitivity causes them to hear the slightest hint of “no” as a personal rejection and they need a softer ver- sion. Use all three steps for them. Others do not take it as personally, and a two-part no works well.

There are some people that will argue with and attempt to manipulate anything we say. A two-part no works better with these.

| **Acknowledge**         | **Circumstances**                          | **Transform**                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **I’d love to.**        | **However, I am busy.**                    |                                   |
| **Thanks for asking.**  | **Not this time.**                         |                                   |
|                         | **My boss has already scheduled my time.** | **If you want, you can ask her.** |
| **Sounds interesting.** | **I have other commitments.**              |                                   |
|                         | **I have a 3:00 deadline.**                | **I wish I could.**               |



> **Power Thinking to the Rescue**
>
> *What are you telling yourself that keeps you from saying “no”? Don’t think:*
>
> — If I say no, they may not like me. 
>
> — I better be nice.
>
> — I shouldn’t say what I think.
>
> *Instead, use Power Thinking. Think:*
>
> - What are my true priorities?
>
> - What response best serves my true priorities?
>
> - How can I communicate that as graciously and effectively as possible?



### When a Simple “NO” Is a PowerPhrase

Stronger PowerPhrases can be called for when:

1. The listener is unusually direct,

2. The listener is manipulative or a “taker,” or

3. The listener hears acknowledgement as uncertainty or as an opening.
