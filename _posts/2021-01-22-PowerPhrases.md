## Poison Phrases vs PowerPhrases

### 1. Avoid Filler Poison Phrases

Qualifiers, hedges and softener phrases weaken your message. Anything you say that does not add to your message makes it weaker:

— Well...

— Sort of...

— I just...

— I would tend to... 

— I guess...


Use:

- **This is the best proposal...**

Instead of :

- You know? 
- Isn’t it?
- Right?
- Do you see?



### 2. Replace Indecisive Poison Phrases WithDecisive PowerPhrases

Speak with certainty and decisiveness. If you cannot be certain on one position, express what you can be certain about.

| **Avoid**                     | **Replace with**               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| I should...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I’ll try...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I might be able to...         | **What I can commit to is...** |
| I sort of think...            | **I know...**                  |
| It’s just my opinion...       | **I believe...**               |
| I would tend to think...      | **I think...**                 |
| You might want to consider... | **I recommend...**             |

###  3. Replace Poison Phrases That Deflect Due Credit and Replace Them With PowerPhrases That Accept Due Credit

| **Avoid**            | **Replace with**                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| I got lucky.         | **I worked hard.**                    |
| It was nothing...    | **Thanks for noticing.**              |

| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| I’ll have to...                                         | **I’ll be glad to...**                          |
| I can’t...                                              | **What I can do is...**                         |
| I am spending time...                                   | **I am investing time...**                      |

| Don’t forget to...(log off of your computer.)           | **Be certain to...(log off of your computer.)** |

### 5. Replace Absolute Poison Phrases and Labels With Accurate PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**            | **Replace with**                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| You always...        | **On several occasions you have...**                       |

| You’re lazy.         | **Your performance is not up to standard.**                |
| You are incompetent. | **There are several mistakes here that need to be fixed.** |

### 6. Replace Victim Poison Phrases With PowerPhrases That Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due

Avoid saying:

- You make me so mad.

- You make me feel wonderful !

Those phrases imply you have no control over your own emotions. You don’t want to send that message. Avoid implying that you do not have the ability to choose alter- native thoughts and behaviors.

You may have heard it suggested that you should replace accusative sounding “you” statements with “I” state- ments, such as:

- I feel angry when you...

- I feel wonderful when you...

If the subject of your communication is your anger or wonderful feelings, the above statements are appropriate and accurate PowerPhrases. If the subject is something else, the above statements are not PowerPhrases.

If the point you want to make is that Joe’s tardiness caus- es you all kinds of problems, do not make Joe or yourself the subject of the communication. Rather than saying:

*— You make me mad when you come late.*

or:

*— I get angry when you are late.*

Use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Em- phasis Where It Is Due**, such as:

- Starting late causes serious problems which we need to address.



Do not say:

*— You are not being clear. (Accusatory)*

*— I am not following you. (Makes you the subject.)*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due,** such as:

- Please clarify this point.

- That last point is not clear to me.

### 7. Replace Hints and Vague Poison Phrases With Specific PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                          | **Replace with**                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I sure wish someone would...       | **Will you...**                                              |
| I’d like to have something like... | **I want ___ by___ because___.**                             |
| You need to do a better job.       | **Your performance needs to be improved. Here are the criteria for acceptable performance. Number one...** |

### 8. Avoid Emotional Poison Phrases in Business Situations Where Factual Action-Based PowerPhrases Hold More Power

| **Avoid**                         | **Replace with**                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I feel great about this proposal. | **This proposal will improve our bottom line by ___.**       |
| I don’t like this idea.           | **There are three serious problems with this idea. First...** |
| I am angry about this delay.      | **How do you plan to get back on schedule after this delay?** |

###  9. Avoid Passive Poison Phrases and Replace With Active PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                                       | **Replace with**                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| The acquisition contract was signed by the CFO. | **The CFO signed the acquisition contract.** |
| The bone was buried by the dog.                 | **The dog buried the bone.**                 |



## How to say "No"

### The Three-Step Process for Saying “No”

When You Refuse a Request, **ACT**!

**1. Acknowledge** their request.

Say something to recognize their request. Make a short comment to let them know that you heard them and you are considering what they said.

**2.** Clarify your **Circumstance.**

Tell them a little bit about your own situation. Be brief. Mention what it is that keeps you from being able to honor their request.

**3. Transform** your refusal into a positive. Suggest alternatives or make a comment that reaffirms the relationship such as:

- Some other time.

Put them all together and you have a three-step “no.”

- It sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately I have other priorities. Perhaps next time I can.



| **Acknowledge**                     | **Circumstances**                                            | **Transform**                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| I understand this is important.     | My situation is ...                                          | Perhaps next time.                              |
| Ordinarily I would love to help.    | My policy is ...                                             | Thanks for asking.                              |
| I appreciate you thinking of me.    | I have other plans...                                        | I’m sure you’ll find the right person you need. |
| I would if I could.                 | I have other involvements.                                   | Have you considered..?                          |
| I wish I could help out here.       | I’m not well-suited to do what you want.                     | Here’s an option...                             |
| I see you need help.                | After looking at my calendar I see I can’t give you the help you need. | Have you considered asking ___?                 |
| I’m honored that you thought of me. | After realizing the scope of the request, I choose to pass.  | I wish you success.                             |

### Saying “No” in Two Parts

When you say no in two parts, it sounds stronger. Some people’s sensitivity causes them to hear the slightest hint of “no” as a personal rejection and they need a softer ver- sion. Use all three steps for them. Others do not take it as personally, and a two-part no works well.

There are some people that will argue with and attempt to manipulate anything we say. A two-part no works better with these.

| **Acknowledge**         | **Circumstances**                          | **Transform**                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **I’d love to.**        | **However, I am busy.**                    |                                   |
| **Thanks for asking.**  | **Not this time.**                         |                                   |
|                         | **My boss has already scheduled my time.** | **If you want, you can ask her.** |
| **Sounds interesting.** | **I have other commitments.**              |                                   |
|                         | **I have a 3:00 deadline.**                | **I wish I could.**               |



> **Power Thinking to the Rescue**
>
> *What are you telling yourself that keeps you from saying “no”? Don’t think:*
>
> — If I say no, they may not like me. 
>
> — I better be nice.
>
> — I shouldn’t say what I think.
>
> *Instead, use Power Thinking. Think:*
>
> - **What are my true priorities?**
>
> - **What response best serves my true priorities?**
>
> - **How can I communicate that as graciously and effectively as possible?**



### When a Simple “NO” Is a PowerPhrase

Stronger PowerPhrases can be called for when:

1. The listener is unusually direct,

2. The listener is manipulative or a “taker,” or

3. The listener hears acknowledgement as uncertainty or as an opening.



### Turning Your NO Into a Negotiation

Sometimes, rather than completely refusing a request or offer, you can suggest alternatives. For example, when one assistant was asked to make copies, she said she would love to but she had a huge stack of orders to file. Then she used the PowerPhrase:

- **I’ll do it if you’ll...(help file orders).**

| Acknowledge| Circumstances| Transform                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| I know this project is top priority. | In order to meet the deadline I need to have uninterrupted time. | I can do this if you’ll answer the phones. |
| I know this is important. | I am working on the XYZ account. | Which is the priority? |
|                                      |                                                              | What can I put aside to make time to complete this? |

### PowerPhrases That Buy You Time

Delay phrases lack the power of a clear refusal, but are superior to a yes when you do not mean it. Learn the **PowerPhrases for Buying Time.**

- Let me get back to you.
- I need to check on a few things before answering you.
- I need to give this consideration before responding.
- Let me think about it and let you know.
- I’ll see what I can do and tell you tomorrow.

### When They Ask, “Will You Do Me a Favor?”

Avoid saying:

*— Sure.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Getting Clarification Before Agreeing,** such as:

- What do you need?
- I just might! What is it?
- Tell me what and I’ll see.
- I need to know what the favor is before I can answer you.


## PowerPhrases That Transform Conflicts Into Understanding

> **Power Thinking to the Rescue**
>
> *Avoid thinking:*
>
> *— I better avoid this disagreement. — I can’t handle conflict.
>  — Who do they think they are?*
>
> *Instead, choose Power Thoughts, such as:*
>
> - **There is a solution here.**
> - **Conflict is a normal part of life and we will get to the other side.**
> - **I can stay calm and express myself gracefully.**
> - **What do I want? What do they want? How can we resolve this?**

When conflicts arise, you must know how to make your **CASE**! That means:

- **Clarify** their position
- **Assert** your position
- **Seek** solutions and
- **Evaluate** options and create agreements.

### 1: Clarifying Their Position

> Seek first to understand, and make it clear to them that you do. Then seek to be understood.

#### Ask Clarifying Questions

You will get excellent results when you **demonstrate interest and concern as the first step** in managing conflict. Explore your assumptions by asking questions. Ask your questions gracefully. 

Watch out for set-up questions like:
- *Why...?*
- Why don’t you ever...?
- Why do you always...?

Also avoid accusative, closed-ended questions that result in defensiveness, such as:

- Did you do that to sabotage me?
- Are you out to get me?

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase to Ask Clarifying Questions,** such as:

- **Help me to understand...**
- **Let me make sure I understand you clearly...**
- **Are you aware...? (I LOVE this one!)**
- **Your intentions are not clear to me. Can you help me out here?**
- **What did you mean by...?**

#### Acknowleage Withou Agreeing

Many of their answers will probably anger or upset you. But we should keep listening to them, and continue to seek to understand. It won’t help you to say:

*— That is a ridiculous idea!
 — You are kidding, right?
 — How could you possibly think that? — You’re wrong!*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase to Acknowledge Without Agreeing**, such as:

- **I see. Tell me more.**
- **This is a big issue for you.**
- **I might feel that way if I was in your shoes.**
- **That’s an interesting perspective.**
- **I did not realize that you felt that way.**
- **I had not considered that perspective.**
- **Please continue.**
- **That may be.**
- **I appreciate your sharing your experience. What else do I need to know?**

#### Ask Questions That Confirm Understanding

At various intervals, use PowerPhrases to **Ask Questions That Confirm Understanding**, such as:

- **This is my understanding of what you are saying... What do I still need to know to understand your perspective?**
- **What I hear you saying is... Is my understanding correct?**
