## Poison Phrases vs PowerPhrases

### 1. Avoid Filler Poison Phrases

Qualifiers, hedges and softener phrases weaken your message. Anything you say that does not add to your message makes it weaker:

— Well...

— Sort of...

— I just...

— I would tend to... 

— I guess...


Use:

- **This is the best proposal...**

Instead of :

- You know? 
- Isn’t it?
- Right?
- Do you see?



### 2. Replace Indecisive Poison Phrases WithDecisive PowerPhrases

Speak with certainty and decisiveness. If you cannot be certain on one position, express what you can be certain about.

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| I’ll try...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I might be able to...         | **What I can commit to is...** |
| I sort of think...            | **I know...**                  |
| It’s just my opinion...       | **I believe...**               |

### 5. Replace Absolute Poison Phrases and Labels With Accurate PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**            | **Replace with**                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| You are incompetent. | **There are several mistakes here that need to be fixed.** |

### 6. Replace Victim Poison Phrases With PowerPhrases That Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due

Avoid saying:

- You make me so mad.

- You make me feel wonderful !

Those phrases imply you have no control over your own emotions. You don’t want to send that message. Avoid implying that you do not have the ability to choose alter- native thoughts and behaviors.

You may have heard it suggested that you should replace accusative sounding “you” statements with “I” state- ments, such as:

- I feel angry when you...

- I feel wonderful when you...

If the subject of your communication is your anger or wonderful feelings, the above statements are appropriate and accurate PowerPhrases. If the subject is something else, the above statements are not PowerPhrases.

If the point you want to make is that Joe’s tardiness caus- es you all kinds of problems, do not make Joe or yourself the subject of the communication. Rather than saying:

*— You make me mad when you come late.*

or:

*— I get angry when you are late.*

Use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Em- phasis Where It Is Due**, such as:

- Starting late causes serious problems which we need to address.



Do not say:

*— You are not being clear. (Accusatory)*

*— I am not following you. (Makes you the subject.)*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due,** such as:

- Please clarify this point.

- That last point is not clear to me.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I sure wish someone would...       | **Will you...**                                              |
| I’d like to have something like... | **I want ___ by___ because___.**                             |
| You need to do a better job.       | **Your performance needs to be improved. Here are the criteria for acceptable performance. Number one...** |

| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
