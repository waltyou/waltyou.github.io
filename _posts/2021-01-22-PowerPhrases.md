## Poison Phrases vs PowerPhrases

### 1. Avoid Filler Poison Phrases

Qualifiers, hedges and softener phrases weaken your message. Anything you say that does not add to your message makes it weaker:

— Well...

— Sort of...

— I just...

— I would tend to... 

— I guess...


Use:

- **This is the best proposal...**

Instead of :

- You know? 
- Isn’t it?
- Right?
- Do you see?



### 2. Replace Indecisive Poison Phrases WithDecisive PowerPhrases

Speak with certainty and decisiveness. If you cannot be certain on one position, express what you can be certain about.

| **Avoid**                     | **Replace with**               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| I should...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I’ll try...                   | **I will...**                  |
| I might be able to...         | **What I can commit to is...** |
| I sort of think...            | **I know...**                  |
| It’s just my opinion...       | **I believe...**               |
| I would tend to think...      | **I think...**                 |
| You might want to consider... | **I recommend...**             |

###  3. Replace Poison Phrases That Deflect Due Credit and Replace Them With PowerPhrases That Accept Due Credit

| **Avoid**            | **Replace with**                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| I got lucky.         | **I worked hard.**                    |
| It was nothing...    | **Thanks for noticing.**              |
| This old thing?      | **Thank you.**                        |
| Anyone could have... | **I’m pleased with the outcome too.** |

### 4. Replace Negative Poison Phrases With Positive PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                                               | **Replace with**                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Everything went wrong...                                | **I learned from some setbacks.**               |
| I’ll have to...                                         | **I’ll be glad to...**                          |
| I can’t...                                              | **What I can do is...**                         |
| I am spending time...                                   | **I am investing time...**                      |
| I’m no good at...                                       | **I’m getting better at...**                    |
| You’ll have to excuse...                                | **Here it is...**                               |
| If only I had...                                        | **Starting now I will...**                      |
| This is bad...                                          | **What good can we get out of this?**           |
| I can’t get to this until...                            | **I can get to this by...**                     |
| Don’t forget to...(log off of your computer.)           | **Be certain to...(log off of your computer.)** |

### 5. Replace Absolute Poison Phrases and Labels With Accurate PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**            | **Replace with**                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| You always...        | **On several occasions you have...**                       |
| I never...           | **Up until now I have not...**                             |

| You’re lazy.         | **Your performance is not up to standard.**                |
| You are incompetent. | **There are several mistakes here that need to be fixed.** |

### 6. Replace Victim Poison Phrases With PowerPhrases That Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due

Avoid saying:

- You make me so mad.

- You make me feel wonderful !

Those phrases imply you have no control over your own emotions. You don’t want to send that message. Avoid implying that you do not have the ability to choose alter- native thoughts and behaviors.

You may have heard it suggested that you should replace accusative sounding “you” statements with “I” state- ments, such as:

- I feel angry when you...

- I feel wonderful when you...

If the subject of your communication is your anger or wonderful feelings, the above statements are appropriate and accurate PowerPhrases. If the subject is something else, the above statements are not PowerPhrases.

If the point you want to make is that Joe’s tardiness caus- es you all kinds of problems, do not make Joe or yourself the subject of the communication. Rather than saying:

*— You make me mad when you come late.*

or:

*— I get angry when you are late.*

Use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Em- phasis Where It Is Due**, such as:

- Starting late causes serious problems which we need to address.



Do not say:

*— You are not being clear. (Accusatory)*

*— I am not following you. (Makes you the subject.)*

Instead use a **PowerPhrase to Place Responsibility and Emphasis Where It Is Due,** such as:

- Please clarify this point.

- That last point is not clear to me.

### 7. Replace Hints and Vague Poison Phrases With Specific PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                          | **Replace with**                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I sure wish someone would...       | **Will you...**                                              |
| I’d like to have something like... | **I want ___ by___ because___.**                             |
| You need to do a better job.       | **Your performance needs to be improved. Here are the criteria for acceptable performance. Number one...** |

### 8. Avoid Emotional Poison Phrases in Business Situations Where Factual Action-Based PowerPhrases Hold More Power

| **Avoid**                         | **Replace with**                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I feel great about this proposal. | **This proposal will improve our bottom line by ___.**       |
| I don’t like this idea.           | **There are three serious problems with this idea. First...** |
| I am angry about this delay.      | **How do you plan to get back on schedule after this delay?** |

###  9. Avoid Passive Poison Phrases and Replace With Active PowerPhrases

| **Avoid**                                       | **Replace with**                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| The acquisition contract was signed by the CFO. | **The CFO signed the acquisition contract.** |
| The bone was buried by the dog.                 | **The dog buried the bone.**                 |



## How to say "No"

### The Three-Step Process for Saying “No”

When You Refuse a Request, **ACT**!

**1. Acknowledge** their request.

Say something to recognize their request. Make a short comment to let them know that you heard them and you are considering what they said.

**2.** Clarify your **Circumstance.**

Tell them a little bit about your own situation. Be brief. Mention what it is that keeps you from being able to honor their request.

**3. Transform** your refusal into a positive. Suggest alternatives or make a comment that reaffirms the relationship such as:

- Some other time.

Put them all together and you have a three-step “no.”

- It sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately I have other priorities. Perhaps next time I can.



| **Acknowledge**                     | **Circumstances**                                            | **Transform**                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| I understand this is important.     | My situation is ...                                          | Perhaps next time.                              |
| Ordinarily I would love to help.    | My policy is ...                                             | Thanks for asking.                              |
| I appreciate you thinking of me.    | I have other plans...                                        | I’m sure you’ll find the right person you need. |
| I would if I could.                 | I have other involvements.                                   | Have you considered..?                          |
| I wish I could help out here.       | I’m not well-suited to do what you want.                     | Here’s an option...                             |
| I see you need help.                | After looking at my calendar I see I can’t give you the help you need. | Have you considered asking ___?                 |
| I’m honored that you thought of me. | After realizing the scope of the request, I choose to pass.  | I wish you success.                             |

### Saying “No” in Two Parts

When you say no in two parts, it sounds stronger. Some people’s sensitivity causes them to hear the slightest hint of “no” as a personal rejection and they need a softer ver- sion. Use all three steps for them. Others do not take it as personally, and a two-part no works well.

There are some people that will argue with and attempt to manipulate anything we say. A two-part no works better with these.

| **Acknowledge**         | **Circumstances**                          | **Transform**                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **I’d love to.**        | **However, I am busy.**                    |                                   |
| **Thanks for asking.**  | **Not this time.**                         |                                   |
|                         | **My boss has already scheduled my time.** | **If you want, you can ask her.** |
| **Sounds interesting.** | **I have other commitments.**              |                                   |
|                         | **I have a 3:00 deadline.**                | **I wish I could.**               |



> **Power Thinking to the Rescue**
>
> *What are you telling yourself that keeps you from saying “no”? Don’t think:*
>
> — If I say no, they may not like me. 
>
> — I better be nice.
>
> — I shouldn’t say what I think.
>
> *Instead, use Power Thinking. Think:*
>
> - **What are my true priorities?**
>
> - **What response best serves my true priorities?**
>
> - **How can I communicate that as graciously and effectively as possible?**



### When a Simple “NO” Is a PowerPhrase

Stronger PowerPhrases can be called for when:

1. The listener is unusually direct,

2. The listener is manipulative or a “taker,” or

3. The listener hears acknowledgement as uncertainty or as an opening.



### Turning Your NO Into a Negotiation

Sometimes, rather than completely refusing a request or offer, you can suggest alternatives. For example, when one assistant was asked to make copies, she said she would love to but she had a huge stack of orders to file. Then she used the PowerPhrase:

- **I’ll do it if you’ll...(help file orders).**

| Acknowledge| Circumstances| Transform                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| I know this project is top priority. | In order to meet the deadline I need to have uninterrupted time. | I can do this if you’ll answer the phones. |
| I know this is important. | I am working on the XYZ account. | Which is the priority? |
|                                      |                                                              | What can I put aside to make time to complete this? |

### PowerPhrases That Buy You Time

Delay phrases lack the power of a clear refusal, but are superior to a yes when you do not mean it. Learn the **PowerPhrases for Buying Time.**

- Let me get back to you.
- I need to check on a few things before answering you.
- I need to give this consideration before responding.
- Let me think about it and let you know.
- I’ll see what I can do and tell you tomorrow.

### When They Ask, “Will You Do Me a Favor?”

Avoid saying:

*— Sure.*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Getting Clarification Before Agreeing,** such as:

- What do you need?
- I just might! What is it?
- Tell me what and I’ll see.
- I need to know what the favor is before I can answer you.


## PowerPhrases That Transform Conflicts Into Understanding

> **Power Thinking to the Rescue**
>
> *Avoid thinking:*
>
> *— I better avoid this disagreement. — I can’t handle conflict.
>  — Who do they think they are?*
>
> *Instead, choose Power Thoughts, such as:*
>
> - **There is a solution here.**
> - **Conflict is a normal part of life and we will get to the other side.**
> - **I can stay calm and express myself gracefully.**
> - **What do I want? What do they want? How can we resolve this?**

When conflicts arise, you must know how to make your **CASE**! That means:

- **Clarify** their position
- **Assert** your position
- **Seek** solutions and
- **Evaluate** options and create agreements.

### 1: Clarifying Their Position

> Seek first to understand, and make it clear to them that you do. Then seek to be understood.

#### Ask Clarifying Questions

You will get excellent results when you **demonstrate interest and concern as the first step** in managing conflict. Explore your assumptions by asking questions. Ask your questions gracefully. 

Watch out for set-up questions like:
- *Why...?*
- Why don’t you ever...?
- Why do you always...?

Also avoid accusative, closed-ended questions that result in defensiveness, such as:

- Did you do that to sabotage me?
- Are you out to get me?

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase to Ask Clarifying Questions,** such as:

- **Help me to understand...**
- **Let me make sure I understand you clearly...**
- **Are you aware...? (I LOVE this one!)**
- **Your intentions are not clear to me. Can you help me out here?**
- **What did you mean by...?**

#### Acknowleage Without Agreeing

Many of their answers will probably anger or upset you. But we should keep listening to them, and continue to seek to understand. It won’t help you to say:

*— That is a ridiculous idea!
 — You are kidding, right?
 — How could you possibly think that? — You’re wrong!*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase to Acknowledge Without Agreeing**, such as:

- **I see. Tell me more.**
- **This is a big issue for you.**
- **I might feel that way if I was in your shoes.**
- **That’s an interesting perspective.**
- **I did not realize that you felt that way.**
- **I had not considered that perspective.**
- **Please continue.**
- **That may be.**
- **I appreciate your sharing your experience. What else do I need to know?**

#### Ask Questions That Confirm Understanding

At various intervals, use PowerPhrases to **Ask Questions That Confirm Understanding**, such as:

- **This is my understanding of what you are saying... What do I still need to know to understand your perspective?**
- **What I hear you saying is... Is my understanding correct?**

### 2. Assert Your Own Position

Use a **PowerPhrase for Requesting Uninterrupted Time to Express Yourself**, such as:

- **You acknowledge that I understand your position. Will you give me five minutes of uninterrupted time to explain mine?**
- **You have made some valid points that make a lot of sense from where you stand. Please hear me out as I describe how it looks to me.**
- **Are you ready to hear how I see it?**

There are three steps to asserting your position in conflict: (A) Describe the problem, (B) communicate the impact, and (C) request a new behavior.

#### A. Describe the problem

Think of yourself as an attorney. Attorneys cannot say:

*— You are out to get me.
— Obviously, my assignments are of a low priority to you.
— You micromanage.
 — You never respond to me.
 — I think you were raised in a barn.*

Attorneys must state facts as facts, and leave out opinions.Use **PowerPhrases for Describing the Negative Behavior,** such as:

**• When...**

**• I notice...**

**• The other day...**

**• When I... you...**

Filled in, these sentence stems can sound like the following:

- **When... the time for the meeting regarding the Smith account was changed...**
- **I notice that... the assignment I gave you was moved to the bottom of your project sign-in sheet.**
- **The other day... you checked my work 14 times.**
- **When I spoke... you did not respond.**

>  Power Thinking to the Rescue
>
>  *Certainly you do want to consider their perspective, but do not let their perspective become more important than your own. It won’t help you to say:*
>
>  *— I must be crazy.
>  — They must be crazy.
>  — I shouldn’t be thinking and feeling this way.**
>
>  **Instead, use Power Thinking, such as:**
>
>  - **I am the authority on my view of the situation.**
>
>  - **They are the authority on their view of the situation.**
>  - **They have a right to their opinion, and I have a right to mine.**
>  - **I have a right to express my opinion.**



#### B. communicate the impact

Watch out for words like:

*— It messes everything up. (Too vague)*

*— I think you don’t trust me. (Blaming)*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Expressing the Impact of a Behavior,** such as:

- **What happens is...**
- **The impact is...**
- **I think...**
- **I feel...** (Consider the cautions for “I think” and “I feel” in Chapter 2 before using them.)
- **The effect is...**

Filled in these can sound like:

- **What happens is... I feel alienated from the team.**
- **The impact is... I do not receive my work on time and I do not present well at the meeting.**
- **I think... I’m not trusted.**
- **I feel... uncomfortable.**
- **The effect is... I get confused and make more mistakes.**

#### C. request a new behavior

Avoid saying:
*—  Do this... (Sounds dictatorial)*
*—  Don’t do that... (Talk about what you WANT, not what you do not want.)*
*—  You need to... (Be very careful of sentences that start with “you.” It can sound controlling.)*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Requesting a New Behavior,** such as:

- **I need...**
- **I want...**
- **What I want to see happen is...**
- **I prefer...**
- **What would work better is...**
- **What needs to happen is...**
- **I need... to be advised of changes as they occur.**
- **I want... us to work out a standard system for prioritizing work.**
- **I prefer... to work on my own, checking in at regularly scheduled intervals.**

#### D. Consequences

When you express consequences, it is far better to explain the benefits of cooperating than the costs of noncooperation. However, there is a place for both.

Watch out for words like:

*— Do this or else...(Threatening)*

*— If I were you...(Condescending)*

*— You are forcing me to...(Accusatory)*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase for Explaining Conse- quences,** such as:

- **This will...**
- **The benefit to you is...**
- **If this happens again, I will...** 
- **Next time this happens I will...**
- **What this means for you is...**

| **Problem**                                                  | **Impact: Thoughts/ Feelings/Effect**                        | **Request**                                                  | **Consequence**                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **I sent three inquiries without receiving a response.**     | **I think I am being ignored.**                              | **I need a prompt acknowledgement of my inquiries and an indication of when my request will be granted.** | **This will keep me from inundating you with repeated requests.** |
| **My situation is that I have been here for three months and I still do not have a workstation of my own.** | **I feel frustrated. What happens is I have to carry my materials to wherever I can find a station, and it takes quite a while to sort them out.** | **My request is that the next time someone leaves, I be given their desk.** | **The benefit to you is I will be more efficient in my work.** |
| **When you sell products that were designed for my department...** | **The effect is that my claims of exclusivity to my clients are invalidated and they lose trust in me.** | **I need you to stop selling our line. I recommend that you request products to be designed exclusively for your department.** | **If this happens again I will bring the issue to the supervisor.** |
| **When I speak, I notice you are reading the paper.**        | **I believe that you cannot listen to me and read the paper at the same time.** | **Please give me your full attention.**                      | **Next time this happens I will wait until I have your full attention to speak.** |
| **The other day you spoke with my staff about turnaround times.** | **They were upset by the way you addressed them and the standards you expressed. They were so upset that very little work got done that day.** | **I suggest we meet and find a solution to this problem together.** | --                                                           |

### 3: Seeking Solutions

Use a **PowerPhrase to Request That You Negotiate Solutions Together**, such as:

- **What I want to see happen is for us to negotiate solutions together.**
- **I suggest that we kick around a few ideas to see what solutions we can come up with.**
- **If we could come up with a solution that works for us both, would you be interested?**
- **What would it take to make my request possible?**
- **I believe we can work this out to both of our satisfaction. Will you work with me on this?**
- **I need your help to resolve this.**

It suggests that you both complete the following **PowerPhrases for Seeking Solutions:**

**• I think I should...**

**• You think you should...**

**• I think you should...**

**• You think I should...**

Find the points of agreement, and combine the lists into:

**• We think we should...**



### 4: Evaluating Options and Building Agreements

 For each option, use **PowerPhrases to Evaluate Options,** such as:

- **Does this option solve the problem?**
- **Can you and I both live with this option?**
- **Is there any way to improve this option?**
- **Is it realistic?**
- **Are you and I both willing to commit to it in writing?**

f they resist and say that obviously you do not trust them, say:

- **Putting it in writing ensures we have the same understanding.**
- **My policy is to get agreements as clear as possible to avoid surprises later.**
- **Follow-up enables us to review our decisions in case a situation arises that we did not consider.**

At follow-up, ask:

- **How is it working for you?**
- **What needs to change?**
- **Is there anything we did not anticipate?**

### Exit Lines

Knowing when to *stop* talking is as important as knowing when to *start.* If you are upset and emotional, DO NOT CONTINUE! Instead, use an exit line to remove yourself and give yourself time to gain perspective. Here is what you DON’T want to say:

*— I am out of here...(Too abrupt)
— There is no talking to you...(Accusatory) 
— This is a waste of time... (Negative)
— You are an idiot...(Insulting)*

Instead, use a **PowerPhrase Exit Line,** such as:

- **I need to check on some things before continuing this discussion. Let’s meet again at...**
- **I need to take some time to regain perspective before answering you. Let’s talk again Friday.**
- **My policy is not to discuss emotionally charged subjects when I am upset. I need some time now. Let’s talk later.**
- **You deserve respect. Right now, I’m so angry I can’t offer you that. I need ____ minutes.**
- **I’m afraid if we continue this discussion I’ll say something I will regret. Let’s give it a 24-hour rest.**
- **I value our work relationship too much to speak when I am as upset as I am now. Let’s pick this up tomorrow.**
- **I think it is possible that one of us might say something we will wish we hadn’t. Let’s meet later when we are calmer.**

Be aware of two important points about using an exit line.

1. Always say when you will be back.

2. After you use the line, you need to LEAVE! Do not say it unless you mean it.
